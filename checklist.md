[ ] - Do I want the board to prevent updating a cell if it is already taken?
[ ] - Remove all mentions of todo (Test library)
[ ] - Remove Board.toArray (or maybe think about the mashup of data structures around Board)
[ ] - Add tests for Utils functions?
[ ] - Annotate all private (not exposed) functions by prepending _ to their name
[ ] - Better language for creating boards in helpers (something more graphical)





# Notes

[ ] - use of language and compromises for Board.winningMark
[ ] - would like to try work on a board that embeds players order to reduce the number of ways in which an invalid state can occur
